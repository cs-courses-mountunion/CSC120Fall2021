	  <h1>Syllabus for CSC 120, Fall 2018</h1>
			
		<h2>Textbook</h2>
		  <p>
             There is no textbook for CSC 120 this semester.&nbsp; Selected readings will be assigned throughout
			 the semester from the Mount Union Library's SAFARI TECH BOOKS subscription, which gives free full-text
			 access to all students.
		 </p>

		<h2>Attendance</h2>
		  <p>
             Students are expected to attend all classes and all labs.&nbsp; A student's grade will be lowered one
			 grade level for missing more than four (4) class meetings (excused or unexcused).&nbsp; Grades will continue
			 to be lowered one grade level for each class missed after the fourth absence from class.
		  </p>
		  <p>
             Cell phones must be off or in vibrate mode
             during all classes and labs. Use of electronic devices such as cell
			 phones, IPods, and PDAs is not allowed during any in-class quiz, test or other type of
			 evaluation.
		  </p>

		<h2>Expectations of Students</h2>
		  <p>
             CSC 120 includes the expectation that students will spend a significant
			 amount of outside-of-class time working on assignments.&nbsp; Computer
			 programming assignments must be completed outside of class time, your
			 instructor may give written homework assignments to be completed between
			 class sessions, and
			 in-class labs that are not finished during the class period when assigned
			 must be completed by the start of the 
			 SECOND class session after the date of the lab to receive
			 full credit.&nbsp; You simply cannot succeed in this course without 
			 spending time outside of class studying and working on course 
			 assignments / activities.
		  </p>
		  <p>
		     Some students will have no prior programming experience at the start of this course, while others may have written some computer programs in the past.&nbsp; No prior programming experience is assumed on the part of students, but the course does move at a brisk pace.&nbsp; Students are advised to keep up with assignment deadlines and course work throughout the semester, and if more challenge is desired, to explore additional programming techniques as appropriate.
		  </p>

		<h2>Make-Up Work</h2>
		  <p>
             Programming Assignments are due at the BEGINNING of the class period on the
			 due date.&nbsp; Penalty for late Programming Assignments = &ndash;20% of 
			 the points for the assignment per lecture period work is submitted
			 late.&nbsp; Make-ups for In-class Graded Activities or Tests will be 
			 available/acceptable only with a legitimate excuse approved by
			 the Instructor (WARNING:&nbsp; Make-up quizzes and tests may be more 
			 difficult than regular exams!).
			 &nbsp; Missing the final exam results in a zero for the exam unless 
			 the Dean has approved an Incomplete Grade or a Withdrawn Grade.

<p>After all points are added up, the percentage will be rounded to the nearest 
integer. For example, 895 points would be 89.5%, which will round to 90, and 894 
points would be 89.4%, which will round to 89.</p>

<h2>Accessibility Information</h2>
<p>
Any student with a documented disability requiring academic accommodations
should speak with the Office of Student Accessibility Services,
and with the instructor, as early in the semester as possible.
Student Accessibility Services is located in Room 88 of Hoover-Price Campus Center,
Phone 330-823-7372, email saracuka@mountunion.edu.
All discussions will remain confidential.</p>

<h2>Academic Honesty</h2>
<p>
Students should be familiar with the university-wide policy concerning academic honesty
in the university catalogue and referenced in the student handbook.
</p>
<p>
It is OK or even encouraged to help each other with labs,
but you should still attempt to figure things out for yourself first.
</p>
<p>
For Programming Project assignments you are each to do your own work.
When you need help, the first resource should be your notes and samples from class
and your other labs and projects.
Next should be one of the CSIS professors or the teaching assistant(s).
</p>
<p>
If you do ask a classmate or another student for help,
you must document explicitly in that section of code and in the comment header at the top
the name of the person who helped and what help they provided (which method and/or code segment).
</p>
<p>
If you use code fragments you found in a book, on a website, or from some other source,
you must document explicitly in that section of code and in the comment header at the top
the exact source  and exactly which code segment you copied.
</p>
<p>
You must never copy other students' code.
You should make no attempt to even look at their code unless they have asked you for help.
</p>
<p>
The University of Mount Union Catalogue clearly states that,
"Plagiarism and/or any other form of cheating or dishonesty will subject the student involved to
punitive action ranging from failure of an assignment to possible suspension or dismissal from the University."
</p>


        <h2> Course Goal </h2>
          <p>
             Students will learn to create algorithms to solve programming problems
			 as well as learn to write Java programs to implement algorithms.
          </p>

		<h2>Course Objectives</h2>			
		  <p>
<em> Upon completion of this course, the student should be able to: </em>
<ul>
	<li>explain how software components interact to execute Java programs
	    and manage data</li>

	<li>create, compile, and execute Java programs</li>

	<li>declare, instantiate and  use objects that come from one or more class definitions
	    </li>

	<li>declare and use constants and variables represented as one of the
	    Java primitive data types</li>

	<li>write a syntactically-correct Java method signature, when given the number
	    and types of parameters and the return type</li>

	<li>write a complete, syntactically-correct Java method to solve a specific problem</li>

	<li>write a syntactically-correct Java method invocation, when given the signature of the method</li>

	<li>write a complete, syntactically-correct Java class to model graphical or non-graphical entities</li>

	<li>write syntactically- and semantically-correct Java statements to compute the total,
	    average, minimum and maximum value of a series or collection of numerical values</li>

		before, during and after manipulation, <b>write the output</b> of the program on paper</li>

	<li>given a programming problem whose solution requires using objects from one or more
        of: the Graphics class, GUI component classes, Strings, one- or two-dimensional arrays,
        and/or user-defined classes (graphical or non-graphical), <b>write an algorithm</b>
        to solve the problem</li>

	<li>given an algorithm which uses objects from one or more of:
	    the Graphics class, GUI component classes, Strings, one- or two-dimensional arrays,
	    and/or user-defined classes (graphical or non-graphical), <b>translate the algorithm</b>
	    into syntactically- and semantically-correct Java source code</li>
